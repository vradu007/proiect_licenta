A java swing hr management application

This simple application was my Graduation Project. 

It was done in Java using the Swing GUI Framework to create a popup-style application.

The purpose of the application is to be a tool used by the hr department mainly, and seldom by other employees of a company.

The app is connected to a MySQL database and is capable of managing the employees and departments of a copmpany, storing and retrieving data, filtering, and some other functionalities.

The purpose of the app is to prove the developer's knowledge of Java, SQL, the way Java interacts with SQL, and the MVC pattern, which is present in this project.

Thanks for your interest in my work!
